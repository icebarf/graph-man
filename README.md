## Problem Definition

Design a program to represent linear and quadratic equations in the form of a Graph. The input is provided in the command line. Support for basic trigonometric functions such as sin(), cos() and tan(). Multiple equations should be supported.

## Roles of each member

Idea for the project was given by Amritpal Singh. Jagraj has been collecting information on different methods of displaying graphs. Manraj Singh decided the format of input command line. Amritpal has done the programming of the project. It took 2 days to finish the project. All project files have been completed as per Amritpal Singh’s review.

## Reasons for the topic

Graphs have been taught to students as a form of representation of data. The project aims at a programmatic approach towards the same. It helps students visualise these mathematical equations and their trends. This helps them understand graphs and equations without all the manual labour of going through the whole process of plotting graphs of linear equations.

## Goals

- To present linear equations in the graph.
- Analyze one or more equations graphically and their relation.
- Display graphs cleanly to envision the mathematical logic.
- Reduce manual work in producing graphs

## Minimum Hardware Specifications

CPU: x86 or x86_64 CPU by INTEL or AMD

RAM: 1 Gb

Disk Space: 1 Gb

## Minimum Software Specifications

Python: v3.0+

Dependencies: Matplotlib, Numpy, regex, math

OS: GNU/Linux or Microsoft Windows

## Limitations
- Python

The project itself is written in Python which is inherently slow. Thus the overall process is very slow compared to compiled languages.

- Equations

Currently the project only supports linear, quadratic equations and trigonometric functions. The project needs to support Cubic Equations and multiple equations at once and so on…
